Art and Images
##############

When you create a new Standard Ebooks draft using the :bash:`se create-draft` tool, you’ll already have templates for the cover and titlepage images present in :path:`./images/`.

Text in these SVG files is represented as text, not paths, so you can edit them using a text editor and not an SVG editor. Then, the :bash:`se build-images` tool converts these text-based source images into path-based compiled images, for distribution in the final epub file. We do this so to avoid having to distribute the font files along with the epub.

To develop cover and titlepage images, you must have the free `League Spartan <https://github.com/theleagueof/league-spartan>`__ and `Sorts Mill Goudy <https://github.com/theleagueof/sorts-mill-goudy>`__ fonts installed on your system.

Complete list of files
**********************

A complete set of image source files consists of:

-	:path:`./images/cover.source.jpg`: The full source image used for the cover art, in as high a resolution as possible. Can be of any image format, but typically we end up with JPGs.

-	:path:`./images/cover.jpg`: A cropped part of the source image that will serve as the actual image file we use in the cover. Must be exactly 1400w × 2100h.

-	:path:`./images/cover.svg`: The SVG source file for the cover, with any text represented as actual, editable text. Must be exactly 1400w × 2100h pixels. Since the final cover image SVG has the text converted to paths, we keep this file around to make it easier to make changes to the cover in the future.

-	:path:`./src/epub/images/cover.svg`: The final SVG cover image. This image should be exactly like :path:`./images/cover.svg`, but with the text converted to paths.

	This image is generated by the :bash:`se build-images` tool.

-	:path:`./images/titlepage.svg`: The SVG source file for the titlepage, with any text represented as actual, editable text. Must be exactly 1400 pixels wide, but the height must exactly match the text height plus some padding (described below).

-	:path:`./src/epub/images/titlepage.svg`: The final SVG titlepage image, with text converted to paths just like the cover page.

	This image is generated by the :bash:`se build-images` tool.

SVG patterns
************

#.	SVGs are only sized with :html:`viewBox`, not :html:`height` or :html:`width`.

	#.	The :html:`viewBox` attribute consists of whole numbers, without fractions.

	.. tip::

		The :html:`viewBox` attribute is case-sensitive!

#.	The only attributes on the :html:`<svg>` root element are: :html:`xmlns`, :html:`version`, and :html:`viewBox`.

#.	The contents of the SVG’s :html:`<title>` element matches the :html:`alt` attribute of its :html:`<img>` element in the text.

#.	Grouping with :html:`<g>` is avoided, unless it makes semantic sense. Groups whose sole purpose is to apply transforms should have those transforms applied to the children, and the group removed.

#.	The use of fill color is avoided unless strictly necessary. Not defining a fill color allows for night mode compatibility.

#.	The :html:`transform` attribute is illegal; transforms are applied to their elements directly.

	.. tip::

		To apply transforms, try the `Inkscape Apply Transforms extension <https://github.com/Klowner/inkscape-applytransforms>`__, or using Inkscape to save as an “Optimized SVG.”

The cover image
***************

.. warning::

	The SE Editor-in-Chief must review and approve of the cover art you select before you can commit it to your repository.

	**Do not commit cover art without contacting the mailing list first!**

The cover image is auto-generated by the :bash:`se create-draft` tool. The arrangement of the text is a suggestion, and may be changed by the producer in case a more visually-pleasing arrangement is desired.

After completing :path:`./images/cover.svg`, use the :bash:`se build-images` tool to build the rasterized distribution SVG in :path:`./src/epub/images/cover.svg`.

#.	The :html:`<title>` element has a value of :string:`The cover for the Standard Ebooks edition of` followed by the `title string </manual/VERSION/6-standard-ebooks-section-patterns#6.1>`__.

Cover image layout
==================

:bash:`se create-draft` generates :path:`./images/cover.svg` for you with correct dimensions and layout. It’s rarely necessary to edit the cover.

#.	Both the title and author are in League Spartan font with 5px letter spacing in ALL CAPS.

	#. If the author is :string:`Anonymous`, then the author is omitted from the cover image.

#.	The left and right sides of the black title box have at least 40px padding. More padding is preferable over cramming the title in.

#.	Translators, illustrators, and other contributors besides the author do not appear on the cover.

#.	The group of both the title and author lines is horizontally centered in the black title box.


Title line dimensions
---------------------

#.	One-line titles: the line is 80px tall. Example: :italics:`The Prince </ebooks/niccolo-machiavelli/the-prince/w-k-marriott>`, by Niccolò Machiavelli.

#.	Two-line titles: each line is 80px tall, and the second title line is 20px below the first line. Example: :italics:`Crime and Punishment </ebooks/fyodor-dostoevsky/crime-and-punishment/constance-garnett>`, by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

#.	Two-line, very long titles: each line is 60px tall, and the second line is 20px below the first line. Example: :italics:`The Wonderful Adventures of Nils </ebooks/selma-lagerlof/the-wonderful-adventures-of-nils/velma-swanston-howard>`, by Selma Lagerlöf.

#.	Two-line, extremely long titles: each line is 50px tall, and the second line is 20px below the first line. Example: :italics:`The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen </ebooks/rudolph-erich-raspe/the-surprising-adventures-of-baron-munchausen>`, by Rudolph Erich Raspe.

Author line dimensions
----------------------

#.	The first author line begins 60px below the last title line.

#.	One-line authors: the line is 40px tall.

#.	Two-line authors: each line is 40px tall, and the second author line is 20px below the first line.

Cover art
=========

#.	:path:`./images/cover.svg` links to :path:`./images/cover.jpg` as the canvas background.

#.	:path:`./images/cover.jpg` is 1400w × 2100h in pixels, and is compressed as much as possible while maintaining an acceptable image quality. An acceptable level of image quality is more important than file size.

#.	Because :path:`./images/cover.jpg` is an image with large dimensions, it must be sourced from a high-resolution scan. It may not always be possible to locate a high-resolution scan, so a smaller source image may be upscaled *a small amount* to meet the target dimensions.

#.	Cover art is in the “fine art oil painting” style, and in full color. Art not in this style, like ink drawings, woodcuts, medieval-style “flat” paintings, pencil sketches, modern CG art, or black-and-white scans, is not acceptable. Generally watercolor is not acceptable, though some watercolor *may* be acceptable if its appearance is oil-paining-like.

	#.	AI generated art will not be approved, even if it appears to be in the correct style.

	#.	Cover art is not a very famous or easily-recognizable painting, like Da Vinci’s :italics:`Mona Lisa` or Van Gogh’s :italics:`Starry Night`.

#.	:path:`./images/cover.source.svg` is the unmodified source image used to create :path:`./images/cover.jpg`. This image is kept in case changes to the source images are to be made in the future.

#.	The cropped :path:`./images/cover.jpg` is not larger than 1.5 MB.

US-PD clearance
---------------

The paintings we use are all in the U.S. public domain (US-PD). Your task is to locate a painting suitable for the kind of book you’re producing, and then demonstrate that the painting is indeed in the U.S. public domain. 

U.S. copyright law is complicated. Because of this, we require that you demonstrate that a work is in the U.S. public domain by providing a link to either **a page scan of a book published before PD_STRING that reproduces the painting you selected** or **a CC-0 license statement made by the museum holding the original artwork.** *This is a hard requirement* to demonstrate that the painting you selected is in fact in the U.S. public domain. Even if you are certain that a work is in the public domain, it cannot be used unless it can be proven by one of these two methods. You can simplify the process by choosing a cover image from the `SE art database <https://standardebooks.org/artworks>`__. 

If using a printed book, the exact painting must be reproduced, not a similar painting by the same artist and not an etching based on a painting. If relying on a museum declaration, it must be a Creative Commons CC0 declaration.

All cover art, including art from the SE database, should be approved on the mailing list **before** it is committed to your repository.

For more information on finding and copyright clearing images, see `How to choose and create a cover image <https://standardebooks.org/contribute/how-tos/how-to-choose-and-create-a-cover-image>`__.

The titlepage image
*******************

The titlepage image is auto-generated by the :bash:`se create-draft` tool. The arrangement of the text is a suggestion, and may be changed by the producer in case a more visually-pleasing arrangement is desired.

After completing :path:`./images/titlepage.svg`, use the :bash:`se build-images` tool to build the rasterized distribution SVG in :path:`./src/epub/images/titlepage.svg`.

#.	The :html:`<title>` element has a value of :string:`The titlepage for the Standard Ebooks edition of` followed by the `title string </manual/VERSION/6-standard-ebooks-section-patterns#6.1>`__.

Titlepage image layout
======================

#.	The title, author, other contributors are in League Spartan font with 5px letter spacing in ALL CAPS.

	#. If the author or a contributor is :string:`Anonymous`, then they are omitted from the titlepage image.

#.	The titlepage does not include subtitles.

	For example, the titlepage would contain :string:`THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY`, but not :string:`THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY: A NIGHTMARE`.

#.	Names of contributors besides the author are preceded by :string:`translated by` or :string:`illustrated by`. :string:`translated by` and :string:`illustrated by` are set in lowercase Sorts Mill Goudy Italic font.

#.	Only the author, translator, and illustrator are on the titlepage. Other contributors like writers of introductions or annotators are not included.

#.	The canvas has a padding area of 50px vertically and 100px horizontally in which text must not enter.

#.	The viewbox width is exactly 1400px wide.

#.	The viewbox height must *precisely fit the titlepage contents, plus 50px padding*.

Title line dimensions
---------------------

#.	Each title line is 80px tall.

#.	The title is split into as many lines as necessary to fit.

#.	Title lines are separated by a 20px margin between each line.

Author line dimensions
----------------------

#.	The first author line begins 100px below the last title line.

#.	Each author line is 60px tall.

#.	If an author line must be split, the next line begins 20px below the previous one.

#.	For works with multiple authors, subsequent author lines begin 20px below the last author line.


Contributor lines dimensions
----------------------------

#.	“Contributors” are a “contributor descriptor,” like :string:`translated by`, followed by the contributor name on a new line.

#.	The first contributor descriptor line begins 150px below the last author line.

#.	Contributor descriptor lines are 40px tall, all lowercase, in the Sorts Mill Goudy Italic font.

#.	The contributor name begins 20px below the contributor descriptor line.

#.	The contributor name is 40px tall, ALL CAPS, in the League Spartan font.

#.	If there is more than one contributor of the same type (like multiple translators), they are listed on one line. If there are two, separate them with :string:`AND`. If there are more than two, separate them with commas, and :string:`AND` after the final comma. Example: :italics:`Siddhartha </ebooks/hermann-hesse/siddhartha/gunther-olesch_anke-dreher_amy-coulter_stefan-langer_semyon-chaichenets>`, by Hermann Hesse.

#.	If there is more than one contributor type (like both a translator and an illustrator), the next contributor descriptor begins 80px after the last contributor name.

Other images
************

Ebooks often have illustrations outside of the cover and titlepage images. Standard Ebooks ebook repositories distinguish between the source image copy, which is a high-resolution image saved in the repository for future needs, and the distributable image copy, which uses the source image copy as a base but is typically scaled down or otherwise processed, and which is the copy of the image that is distributed with the final ebook.

#.	JPEG and TIFF image filenames end in :path:`.jpg` and :path:`.tif`, respectively, *not* :path:`.jpeg` or :path:`.tiff`.

Source images
=============

The source image is an unedited, raw copy of the image that is in the highest-resolution possible.

#.	Source images are located in :path:`./images/`.

#.	There is always a source image for each corresponding distributable image, even if they are identical.

Distributable images
====================

Distributable images are source images that have been processed for distribution, for example by scaling them down, removing frames, or converting them to SVG.

#.	Distributable images are located in :path:`./src/epub/images/`.

#.	The maximum dimensions for distributable images is 2,000 × 2,000 pixels.

#.	Images that consist of plain black line drawings are converted to SVG for distribution.

#.	Distributable images are not larger than 1.5MB in file size, with the exception of the cover image SVG.
